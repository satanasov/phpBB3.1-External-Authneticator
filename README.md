phpBB3.1-External-Authneticator
===============================

This is basic script showing how to authenticate external application to phpBB3.1 

I have a small XMPP (Ejabberd) server that I need users to authenticate. This is how you I do it.

This is small project but it will grow. I'm planing to add some basic functionality like groups able to authenticate and so on.

WARNING
=======

THIS IS ONLY AN EXAMPLE SCRIPT. IT WORKS FOR ME.

It is as basic as it possibly can be as I follow the KISS principle ... it works and that is all.

Configuration?
==============

There is only one thing you will have to configure:

$phpbb_root_path - must show your root directory.
